# Research Question

**TODO** Update me.

In a cycle sharing system, users pick-up and drop-off bikes at various stations throughout a city, generally without any requirement to return the bike where they obtained it.
As a result, some stations may become *sources* (more bikes are picked-up than dropped-off) and others may become *sinks* (more bikes are dropped-off than picked-up).
I would like to investigate what features of a station's location affect whether it is a source or sink in the system.
This analysis could help to coordinate transportation of bikes between stations so as to rebalance their distribution.
Furthermore, if adding a new station to a system, the choice of location can be informed by a prediction of whether that station would be a source or sink.

# Data

The cycle sharing data comes from the Seattle-based company Pronto.^[`https://www.prontocycleshare.com/data`]
Their 2016 dataset includes the last two years of trip data (`r nrow(trips)` trips in total), including each trip's start and end date, time, and station and the biker's gender and year of birth.
They also include daily weather data, including summary statistics of temperature, dewpoint, humidity, barometric pressure, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation.
To better appreciate the location features of a particular station, I am augmenting the Pronto dataset with data from the Google Maps API^[`https://developers.google.com/maps/`] (e.g., elevation and nearby points-of-interest) for each cycle share station.
