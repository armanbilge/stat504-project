# Question

Which features of a station affect its daily usage?

Can we use these to decide where to place stations?

# Data

## Sources

* Pronto! (October 2014â€“August 2016)
    * record for every trip taken
    * daily weather report
* Google Maps API
    * elevation
    * nearby points-of-interest
* Puget Sound Regional Council Census
    * socio-economic data

## Covariates of Interest

* elevation
* job density
* average income
* also hope to use:
    * number of nearby restaurants
    * number of bus routes at nearest stop

## Confounding Variables

* weather
    * temperature
    * precipitation
* total membership (not in data!)

# Exploration

## Temperature

```{r temperature, echo = F, fig.cap = ''}
plot(full.data$Mean_Temperature_F, full.data$trips)
abline(lm(trips ~ Mean_Temperature_F, data = full.data), col = "red")
```

## Precipitation

```{r precipitation, echo = F, fig.cap = ''}
plot(full.data$Precipitation_In, full.data$trips)
abline(lm(trips ~ Precipitation_In, data = full.data), col = "red")
```

## Estimates

```{r estimates, echo = F}
summary(lm(trips ~ Mean_Temperature_F + Precipitation_In, data = full.data))
```

# Methods

##

* Dropped weekends
* Counted number of daily arrivals per station
* Fit linear model with weather and covariates of interest
* Two independent code bases give same results

## Model

$$
y \sim \beta X + \epsilon, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma I)
$$

* $y$ is daily "in-flow" per station
* $X$ is design matrix including covariates and confounding variables
* no interaction terms (for now)

# Initial Analysis

```{r initial.analysis, echo = F}
summary(lm(trips ~ elevation + jobden + income + Mean_Temperature_F + Precipitation_In, data = inflow.data))
```

# Challenges

## Dependencies between stations

* Total number of bikes remains constant
* Complex network dependencies between stations (not good for linear regression)
* Some stations were installed later on
* Solution: find a subset of stations that seem independent
    * Create a correlation matrix of residuals after regressing on confounding variables

## Heatmap

```{r heatmap, echo = F, fig.cap = ''}
inflow.complete <- inflow.data[!is.na(inflow.data$Mean_Temperature_F) & !is.na(inflow.data$Precipitation_In),]
model <- lm(trips ~ Mean_Temperature_F + Precipitation_In, data = inflow.complete)
inflow.complete$residual <- residuals(model)
x <- unstack(inflow.complete[,c("residual", "to_station_id")])
x$"DPD-03" <- NULL
cor.matrix <- cor(data.frame(x))
heatmap.2(cor.matrix, trace = "none", dendrogram = "none")
```

## Total membership

* Data not included in public dataset
* Estimate a fixed effect representing total membership for each month?

# Concluding Remarks

* Temperature and precipitation significantly explain variation
* Coefficients for elevation and socio-economic factors are significant and intuitive
* Possible method for identifying independent stations

# Questions?

Thanks for listening!
