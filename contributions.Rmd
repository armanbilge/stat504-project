# Contributions

All members contributed equally to the project.
Every member identified and collected data (Arman: bike share and Google maps; Yanbo: socio-economic; Xiaoliu: transportation).
Each also processed and analyzed the data independently to validate the results.
As a group, we made decisions about the data and discussed our model, its assumptions, and interpreted our results.

We give permission to the instructor to use our poster in the future for educational purposes.
